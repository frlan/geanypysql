# GeanyPySQL

Making Geany a database client using GeanyPy

## Supported database types

The plugin currently supports:

- SQLite (sqlite3)
- SQLAnywhere  (sqlanydb)

## Featureset

none really so far.

## Installation

To run the plugin, you need GeanyPy running inside your Geany.
Therefor, Python as well as PyGtk is already set up.

To make GeanyPy be able to find GeanyPySQL, you need to place it inside
GeanyPy's plugin folder, which usealy is loacated inside your Geany
configuration directory. E.g. on most Linux distributions it should be
~/.config/geany/plugins/geanypy/pluginsj

It's recommended to create a new folder there e.g. called geanypysql
and put the file into it.

Of course you could place the sources elsewhere and just add a symlink
into that folder.
